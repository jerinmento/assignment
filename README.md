Write a test in Java for the following REST API:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Requirements:

·  Get a random user (userID), print out its email address to console.

·  Using this userID, get this user’s associated posts and verify they contain valid Post IDs (an Integer between 1 and 100).

·  Do a post using the same userID with a non-empty title and body, verify the correct response is returned (since this is a mock API, it might not return Response code 200, so check the documentation).
