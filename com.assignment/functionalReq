Write a test in Java for the following REST API:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Requirements:

  Get a random user (userID), print out its email address to console.

  Using this userID, get this user뭩 associated posts and verify they contain valid Post IDs (an Integer between 1 and 100).

  Do a post using the same userID with a non-empty title and body, verify the correct response is returned (since this is a mock API, it might not return Response code 200, so check the documentation).
